# Sentencing_prediction

This machine learning and deep learning project is the final project for the CS-613 course.
Here using various variables like the age at arrest, description of crime, race, sex and more a prediction is made
about what would be the type of sentencing. There are 4 types of sentencing in the dataset.- 
1. Multiclass Classification using deep learning - accuracy = 70%
2. Decision Tree Multiclass Classifier - accuracy = 
3. Naive Bayes Multiclass Classifier - accuracy = 
4. XGBoost Multiclass Classifier - accuracy = 68% accuracy.
